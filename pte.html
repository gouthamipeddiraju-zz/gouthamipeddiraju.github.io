    <strong>My little background:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    I am a web/mobile app developer aiming to settle in Australia. Getting PR
    was the only option. PTE was the only thing where I can improve points to
    get PR. I just need ‘Superior English’ (79 or more in each of the sections
    (Listening, Reading, Speaking, and Writing)). I started my journey last
    year in May. I attempted the first two times without much practice. Hence,
    the score was around 65-70. Later I took it seriously and I got around 75.
    Below were my results:

<p>
    I didn’t want to end up wasting time and money in reattempting the exam.
    Instead of attending real exam directly I attempted mock exams to analyse
    and improve lacking skills. By trial and error, I have found out what works
    and what doesn’t. Below are the key things I wanted to summarize, which may
    help others.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Perception</strong>
</p>
<p>
    I know that English may not be our own/native language. Even then we need
    to change our perception that English is tough or impossible to achieve.
    And we don’t need to be an expert in English to get the desired score in
    the PTE. I won’t say I am an expert in English, but I can say I achieved
    desired score with smart thinking. We just need commitment, analysis, hard
    work to achieve whatever we want. Set a goal for the required score,
    practice hard, attempt mock test, analyse, be confident and go for the real
    test.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Analysis</strong>
</p>
<p>
    You need to analyse exam pattern and questions format first before starting
    for the preparation. I don’t know who has created below images (Thanks to
    them), but they helped me a lot to analyse main scores and enable scores
    along with the priority questions:
</p>
<p>
    <img
        width="442"
        height="232"
        src="file:////Users/avinashadluri/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image003.jpg"
        alt="A screenshot of a cell phone

    />
</p>
<p>
    · Above one says that top score gaining sections are Repeat sentence, write
    from dictation, RWFIB. These sections have highest score allocation. It
    means that if you are not giving 100% to these questions and if you are not
    confident to these questions – do not expect 79 in the exam.
</p>
<p>
    · Prepare for these 4 sections first then only go to others. I will provide
    tips to prepare for these in below sections
</p>
<p>
    <img
        width="393"
        height="264"
        src="file:////Users/avinashadluri/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image004.jpg"
        alt="A close up of a piece of paper

    />
</p>
<p>
    · Understand first that which section is affecting which enable score. Your
    enable score talks about your strength and weakness, understand that first.
</p>
<p>
    · Try to get 90/90 in each enabling score, which will lead your main score
    to 90 automatically.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Practice</strong>
</p>
<p>
    · I have practised all top 5 sections in ptetutorials, ptestudy, realpte,
    other websites, youtube(careercoves, E2E, v2 PTE, PTE academic, Roman PTE,
    Nikhil PTE, etc.
</p>
<p>
    · I practised all the prediction files provided by ptetutorials, ptestudy,
    some other Chinese websites.
</p>
<p>
    · Trust me, I practised around 1500 questions for WFD &amp; RS, around 500
    for RWFIB, 250 for RO, 800 for ASQ, 200 for RA.
</p>
<p>
    · Practice like hell. Take 50 WFD &amp; RS, practice 1 for each minute and
    do this for at least half an hour continuously. Take 25 RWFIB per day. No
    excuses.
</p>
<p>
    · I recommend 5 weeks to practice before the real exam. 1 mock exam after 2
    weeks and other mock after 2 weeks, the real exam after a week. Analysis
    after each mock is very important.
</p>
<p>
    · Join telegram, whatsapp groups for regular updates, exam memories,
    repeated material.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Tips</strong>
</p>
<p>
    · Templates may take you to near 78 but you need to add your own knowledge
    to enhance it.
</p>
<p>
    · Never use backspace button in exam, which will affect your spelling
    score.
</p>
<p>
    · Time management is the key for success. In real exam, start your attempt
    a bit late so that you will not have much distraction.
</p>
<p>
    · Presence of the mind so important, take multiple breaths to focus more,
    before starting any section.
</p>
<p>
    · Understand the score pattern, when beep sound enables, when to click next
    button, etc.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Speaking </strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    o I tried to maintain the pace of my tone. Never give gaps in sentences.
    Don’t speak too fast.
</p>
<p>
    o But make sure you give appropriate pause at full stops and commas.
</p>
<p>
    o I use MacBook, there is Siri text to speech. I opened prediction files
    and material pdf files and enabled Siri to speak the text. I observed
    different tones, intonations, stress on a few verbs, nouns then tried to
    mimic them in the mock text, which worked well. I suggest you use text to
    speech apps. Voice pitch analyser may work but I prefer the above method to
    analyse the stress and intonations.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Reading</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    o Again, practice is the key. For Reading blanks, you should practice at
    least 30 a day.
</p>
<p>
    o Try to note down meaning of new words.
</p>
<p>
    o Try to guess meanings.
</p>
<p>
    o Try to understand collocations.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Writing</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    o Grammar, grammar, grammar. Brush up basic grammar.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Listening</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    o Keep on listening to audios/podcasts.
</p>
<p>
    o I watched movies without subtitles and tried to guess words. It worked.
</p>
<p>
    o Keep on listening to repeated content.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Important sections </strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>RA </strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    o This section is important for Reading and Speaking. Make sure that your
    pace of speech and pronunciation is good. As I said above, improve
    pronunciation by listening to conversations. Never miss a single word,
    don’t skip articles/prepositions. Some people are so confident that they
    take this easily and speak very fast which they can’t maintain in DI or RL.
    You should speak clear and any person should be able to understand it
    easily. Keep on reading news, blogs.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>RS</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    o Bulk practise is the key. Practise at least 50 a day.
</p>
<p>
    o Try to get at least half of them are correct.
</p>
<p>
    o If a sentence is too long, try to repeat at least half of it. For short
    questions, you should repeat 100%.
</p>
<p>
    o I tried to copy the tone whenever it was tough.
</p>
<p>
    o Never lose fluency.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>DI</strong>
        :
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    o Practice 20 images a day for a week. Templates may help a bit to increase
    the fluency but better to read from the given image. I did not follow any
    template for this. But whenever I get plain images which have less content
    then I followed pteguru90 template:
</p>
<p>
    o
    <strong>
        <img
            width="76"
            height="48"

        />
    </strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Re tell lecture:</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    o I tried to copy all the nouns from the lecture and added all of them in
    my speech.
</p>
<p>
    o Keywords are more important in this section.
</p>
<p>
    o I followed a few lines from the pteguru90 template and few lines from the
    ptetutorial template. However, I tried to make sure that I utilize all the
    keywords from the lecture. Remember, only template will never save you, PTE
    AI is intelligent enough.

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>ASQ</strong>
        :
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    o Practice most repeated material from youtube, ptetutorials, realpte, any
    online purchased material.
</p>
<p>
    o Remember that this section is going to affect your vocabulary, if you are
    not performing well in this, your vocabulary will go down.
</p>
<p>
    o Even if you don’t know the answer try to speak something.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>SWT</strong>
        :
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    o I initially followed templates but after analysing mock tests, I realized
    that neither template nor copy paste will take me to get 90.
</p>
<p>
    o I took 3 sentences from the passage, paraphrased them and replaced them
    in below template:
</p>
<p>
    Sentence1, and Sentence2, and Sentence3
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Essay</strong>
        :
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    o I followed below template with proper usage of keywords.

    />
</p>
<p>
    o I just used my own sentences in body but used the template for
    introduction para.
</p>
<p>
    o Readymade templates may not help you to get 90 but there are instances
    where some universal templates may take you to get 79:

    <li>
        <strong>RWFIB/RFIB/RO</strong>

<p>
    o I practised all FIBs &amp; RO from prediction files, ptetutorials,
    ptestudy, realpte, careercoves, v2 language, etc.
</p>
<p>
    o Try to understand the context of the para, guess the word meaning,
    remember collocation.
</p>
<p>
    o Practise only can save you in this section. Grammar will definitely help
    you in this section.
</p>
<p>
    o Follow PTE sonny English Channel for understanding RO method.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>SST</strong>
        :
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    o I followed SST template from pteturials. I did not copy 100% of the text
    but I tried to make sure that I inserted all captured keywords in
    paragraph. Keywords capturing is the most important thing in this section.

    o An important trick I followed is if you are confused about any word
    whether it is singular or plural try to write down both. PTE WFD section
    works in such a way that it will mark each correct word, if any word is
    wrong it will just skip. Remember that your grammar will be affected by
    this trick.

    o Most famous youtube channels like careercoves, PTE academic gold, V2
    language, Sonny English will definitely help you achieve a good score in
